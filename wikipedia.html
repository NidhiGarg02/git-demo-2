    <p class="one"><textarea name="textarea" id="textarea" rows="20" cols="100">Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS (/ˈrɑːmən/;[1] 7 November 1888 – 21 November 1970) was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering.[2] Using a spectrograph that he developed, he and his student K. S. Krishnan discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its wavelength and frequency. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or Raman scattering. Raman received the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.[3]

        Born to Tamil  parents, Raman was a precocious child, completing his secondary and higher secondary education from St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School at the ages of 11 and 13, respectively. He topped the bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. His first research paper, on diffraction of light, was published in 1906 while he was still a graduate student. The next year he obtained a master's degree. He joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General at age 19. There he became acquainted with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute in India, which allowed him to do independent research and where he made his major contributions in acoustics and optics.</textarea></p>

            Raman's elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar had joined the Indian Finance Service (now Indian Audit and Accounts Service),[20] the most prestigious government service in India. In no condition to study abroad, Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service achieving first position in the entrance examination in February 1907.[21] He was posted in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907</li>
        <li>In 1902, Raman joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai) where his father had been transferred to teach mathematics and physics.</li>
        <li>In 1904, he obtained a B.A. degree from the University of Madras, where he stood first and won the gold medals in physics and English.[10] At age 18, while still a graduate student,</li>
        <li>"Unsymmetrical diffraction bands due to a rectangular aperture" in the British journal Philosophical Magazine in 1906</li>
        <li>He earned an M.A. degree from the same university with highest distinction in 1907</li>
        <li> The work inspired IACS to publish a journal, Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, in 1909 in which Raman was the major contributor</li>
        <li>Raman's article "Newton's rings in polarised light" published in Nature in 1907 became the first from the institute</li>
        <li>In 1909, Raman was transferred to Rangoon, British Burma (now Myanmar), to take up the position of currency officer. After only a few months, he had to return to Madras as his father succumbed to fatal illness</li>
        <li>The subsequent death of his father and funeral rituals compelled him to remain there for the rest of the year.[24] Soon after he resumed office at Rangoon, he was transferred back to India at Nagpur, Maharashtra, in 1910</li>
        <li>Even before he served a year in Nagpur, he was promoted to Accountant General in 1911 and again posted to Calcutta.</li>
